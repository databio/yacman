2025-11-05  Added comprehensive type hints to yacman v1 codebase following Python 3.10+ syntax (using built-in generics like `list[str]` and `str | None`). Annotated all modules (const.py, exceptions.py, alias.py, yacman.py, __init__.py) with type hints for method signatures, return types, and public APIs, configured mypy with proper settings in pyproject.toml, and verified all 51 tests pass without breaking existing functionality.

2025-11-05  Improved type hints after code review: replaced overly-restrictive `dict[str, object]` with more accurate `dict[str, Any]` for YAML data, fixed `priority_get` to error on non-string config values instead of silently ignoring them, replaced `object` with `Any` in helper functions for better semantic clarity, added explicit type annotations to all instance attributes, and clarified that data attribute is always dict (converting list inputs to dict for MutableMapping protocol). All changes validated with mypy and 51 passing tests.
